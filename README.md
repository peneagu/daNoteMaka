## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

there are no installation tips. However, if you want to see what is going on on the backend, right click on api.js - open a terminal, type in "npm start", wait for the system to start listening to port 3001. Now start logging your notes and see them stored in the console!

## Usage

See Installation section for better understanding. However, here is an illustration of functionality.
